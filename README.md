# StatisTik Backend

Backend for StatisTik, an analytics platform for TikTok. 

StatisTik, is an analytics platform for TikTok. Part of the USF B.S.I.T/C.S Senior Project at the University of South Florida. Built with my peers: Brendan Howell, Eddie Roock, and Gilberto Rios

This application is designed to help production managers who manage multiple tiktok accounts for clients. Built on Node.JS and React.

This project requires [statistik-frontend](https://github.com/TraderHowell/statistik-frontend) and the associated PostgreSQL database to function.
